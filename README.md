## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcom to My Page


###
<p align="left">My name is Harry and I'm an engineering student who is passionate about the advancements of artificial intelligence. I am interested in theoretical ML and their applications to real world problems as well as how they can be implemented on a hardware level for efficient computing.</p>

###
In my free time, I try to keep up to date with popular trends in the research communities, explore fields of mathematic (e.g., differential geometry, complex analysis, etc), and play chamber music with my friends.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an industrial engineering degree with a focus on data science and machine learning as well as mathematics and computer hardware on the side. 
- ðŸ”­ I have experienced with training with LLMs, diffusion models on large scale datasets, their training strategies, as well as application of traditional machine learning algorithms.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am interested in many things; to list a few, they are piano, mathematic, violin, and concept design.
